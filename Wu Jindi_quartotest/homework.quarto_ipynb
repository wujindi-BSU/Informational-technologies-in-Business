        "As long as your object is an iterable (ie you can iterate over it), then it can be used in this way in a for loop. The most common examples are lists and tuples, but you can also iterate over strings (in which case each character is selected in turn).

As we saw earlier, what distinguishes a dictionary in Python is that it maps a key to a value, for example \"apple\" might map to \"fruit\". Let's take our example from earlier that mapped cities to temperatures. If we wanted to iterate over *both* keys and values, we can write a for loop like this:\n",

        "Note that we added `.items()` to the end of the dictionary. And note that we didn't *have* to call the key `key`, or the value `value`: these are set by their position. But part of best practice in writing code is that *there should be no surprises*, and writing key, value makes it really clear that you're using values from a dictionary.\n",

The body of the function is then indented relative to the left-most text. Function arguments are defined in brackets following the name, with different inputs separated by commas. Any outputs are given with the `return` keyword, again with different variables separated by commas.\n",

However, this doesn't mean that CO2 levels are directly causing the stock market to rise. Instead, both could be influenced by a common factor, such as economic growth. As economies grow, they often emit more CO2 and also tend to have better stock market performance.\n",

For instance, the number of Nicolas Cage films released might be influenced by the film industry's production schedule, while the number of swimming pool accidents could be influenced by factors such as weather conditions, safety regulations, and public awareness. There is no plausible mechanism through which the release of Nicolas Cage films could cause an increase in swimming pool accidents, or vice versa. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that this correlation is spurious and due to chance or other unobserved variables.\n",
